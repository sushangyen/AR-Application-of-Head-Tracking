Introduction: This is my Final Year Project in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I finished the project in Image and Video Processing Lab, CUHK. 

Abstract: The main objective of this project is to develop the software, which can do the head tracking and combine the 3D model with head tracking result on the screen simultaneously. The first goal of project is to develop the software, which has the function of “ head motion capture”. It means that the software can track facial features position no matter how the subject moves after the frames of video sequence being taken by the RGBD (red-green-blue-depth) camera. Here, we use Microsoft Kinect as the camera, detects the location of objective’s face. The other part of the project is to control the 3D model coordinate and direction vector, according to the direction vector of head (the direction vector of 3D model and head should be same). Finally, we will combine the 3D model and the head-tracking program to generate the result, which shows the subject wearing the 3D model (such as mask, glasses, etc.) on the head.
